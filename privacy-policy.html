			<p>Vinsa, Inc. Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Vinsa, Inc. (“<strong>Company</strong>”) respects the privacy of its users whether they use the Vinsa.ai website (“<strong>Website</strong>”) to participate in interactive programs or simply view the Website. The following Company privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) is designed to inform you, as a user of the Website, about the types of information that Company may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of the Website. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which Company uses and discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information.</p>
<p>Changes to this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. Each time you use the Website, however, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each time you use the Website you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the end of this document) and review any changes since the last time you used the site.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Website Restricted to United States Residents</strong><br />
The Website is hosted on servers located in the United States of America and is intended for use by United States residents. You may not use this service if you are not a United States resident.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong><br />
The Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Company does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
<p><strong>Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br />
<em>Users of the Website Generally</em><br />
“<strong>Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong>” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person.</p>
<p>“<strong>Personally-Identifying Information,</strong>” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person.</p>
<p>Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website.</p>
<p>Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</p>
<p><em>Web Cookies</em><br />
A “<strong>Web Cookie</strong>” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the site. Company uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used.</p>
<p>As with other Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. Company does not attempt to link information gathered using Web Cookies to Personally-Identifying Information.</p>
<p>COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
<p><em>Web Beacons</em><br />
A “<strong>Web Beacon</strong>” is an object that is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page. Company may use Web Beacons on the Website to count users who have visited particular pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique Company may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides.</p>
<p>You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. Third parties are not permitted to use Web Beacons on the Website.</p>
<p><strong>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br />
<em>Website Registration</em></p>
<p>As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person. Company collects a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected by Company about users is information provided by users themselves at the time they sign up to submit materials for a Website interactive program.</p>
<p>Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide Company with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user’s refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain Website features.</p>
<p>BY REGISTERING WITH THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS “COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION” SECTION.</p>
<p><em>On-line Forums and Blogs</em><br />
Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users is disclosed as a matter of course as a result of those users’ use of the Website. USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.</p>
<p><em>DMCA Infringement Notifications, Notices of Violations of Website Terms of Service and Other Communications Directed to Company</em></p>
<p>By submitting a Copyright Infringement Notification or other communication (including communications about content stored on or transmitted through the Website) you consent to have such communication forwarded to the person or entity who stored, transmitted or linked to the content addressed by your communication, in order to facilitate a prompt resolution. For Notices of Violations of Website Terms of Service or other communications (but not DMCA Infringement Notifications), upon request Company will edit out your name and contact information. However, DMCA Infringement Notifications (including any personally identifying information set forth in the Notifications) will be forwarded as submitted to Company without any deletions.</p>
<p><em>Other Disclosures</em><br />
As described in the previous sections titled “Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information,” users may, at their option, disclose their own Personally-Identifying Information by any means they choose, including without limitation [insert ways information can be contributed]. Company will disclose Personally-Identifying information under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>● By Law or to Protect Rights—Company discloses Personally-Identifying Information when required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Company believes in its sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Company, third parties or the public at large.<br />
● Marketing Communications—If users opt-in to receive Company marketing materials upon registration, Company will email users about products and services that Company believes may be of interest to them. Company also will provide users’ email information to third parties, so that those third parties may directly contact users about additional products and services. If a user wishes to opt-out of having their email information provided to third parties at any time after registration, they may do so by sending Company an email at [insert email address]. Even after opting-out, a user may continue to receive marketing emails from third parties to whom Company already has provided the user’s email information. Users will be responsible for directly contacting such third parties to request cessation of further marketing emails.<br />
● Business Transfers; Bankruptcy—Company reserves the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Company’s assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.</p>
<p>Contests, Giveaways and Surveys<br />
From time to time, Company may offer Website users the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions. Any information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, Company may also ask Website users to participate in surveys designed to help Company improve the Website. Any Personally-Identifying Information provided to Company in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey, and will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy only in non-personally-identifying, aggregated form.</p>
<p>Email to Friends Feature and Referral Program<br />
Company offers users the ability to send friends emails about the Website. If users choose to use this feature, be assured that Company only uses friends’ email addresses on a one-time basis to send the requested email.</p>
<p>Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties<br />
<em>Generally</em><br />
Company contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers from disclosing Personally-Identifying Information received from Company, other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy, however, with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. Company neither owns nor controls the third-party websites accessible through the Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party, whether by means of a link on the Website or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, users should inform themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in those users’ discretion, protect their privacy.</p>
<p>Privacy Policy Changes<br />
Company may, in its sole discretion, change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes to Company’s Privacy Policy will also be reflected on this page. Unless Company obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after such time as the revised Privacy Policy takes effect, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policies. Company encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This policy is effective as of and was last updated on May 4, 2020.</p>
